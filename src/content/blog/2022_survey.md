The QOSS survey aims at obtaining a community-wide and industry-wide snapshot that is representative of everyone who codes or wants to code for and with **quantum computing technologies**. We'll share the results publicly to ultimately get a better understanding of the quantum computing community’s needs and background and improve products/services/events and educational material.

The survey covers information on demographics, experience, community, research, tech stacks and specific feedback. A related survey addresses **Diversity & Inclusion** questions.


Please take a couple of minutes to fill out the QOSS Diversity & Inclusion Survey [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/qoss_diversity)


Once we collect all the responses, we will analyze this data based on each subsection, report our findings, and publish the aggregated results on the Unitary Fund website.

If you are a user or developer of software for any kind of quantum technology, we kindly encourage you to take this 5-10 minute survey. **You have time only until September 23rd, 2022** to fill them out:
