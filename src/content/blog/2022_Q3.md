We are excited to share our quarterly update and highlight some of what
UF's been involved with so far this year. We continue to grow the Mitiq
project and Metriq.info platform with a wider community. We hosted two
fantastic interns over the Summer, Maria and Karen, teaming up with
Qubit by Qubit. We awarded 11 grants to amazing projects this quarter,
spanning from the first Rust project supported by UF to an outreach
program for highschool students. Finally, we've released the [Quantum
Open Source Software
Survey](https://unitary.fund/posts/2022_survey_results.html) and
collected over 1000 responses: Thank you all for your continued support
of the open-source quantum ecosystem!

**New from UF**

-   **Mitiq**

    -   The [Mitiq whitepaper](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2022-08-11-774/)
       was published in *Quantum **6**, 774 (2022)*

    -   New Releases:
       [v0.17.1](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/releases/tag/v0.17.1),
       [v0.18.0](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/releases/tag/v0.18.0),
       [v0.19.0](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/releases/tag/v0.19.0)

        -   Version0.17.1 includes support for the latest versions of
           Qiskit (0.37.1), Cirq (1.0.0), and Pyquil (3.2.1).

        -   Version 0.18.0 focused on review and approval of two RFCs,
           one for Readout Error Mitigation (REM) and one for
           Identity Insertion Noise Scaling.

        -   Version 0.19.0 expanded support to the most recent versions
           of Python: 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10, and is now compatible with
           Numpy 1.21.6. We have also added new tools for applying
           learning-based PEC, and introduced a function for learning
           depolarizing noise representations from Clifford circuit
           data.

        -   Read more about learning-based PEC in our updated
           [API-doc](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apidoc.html#module-mitiq.pec.representations.biased_noise).

**News from UF Projects**

-   Qrack and PyQrack

    -   We are thrilled that the quantum computer simulator libraries
       **[Qrack](https://github.com/unitaryfund/qrack/) &
       [PyQrack](https://github.com/unitaryfund/pyqrack/) have
       officially joined the Unitary Fund GitHub organization** of
       open source quantum computing repositories! Qrack is a quantum
       computer gate model simulator written in C++11, released under
       LGPL-3.0.d. PyQrack is Qrack's dependency-free Python ctypes
       wrapper, to expose Qrack shared library binaries directly for
       just-in-time (JIT) execution via a Python interpreter: It
       gained over 300,000 downloads in a few months!

    -   In addition, Qrack's API v8 has been released! The focus of this
       update is the enforcement of bounds and input domain checking,
       to prevent bad user inputs from inducing segmentation faults.
       This quarter also saw Qrack achieve HPC distribution scaling
       to at least 8 GPUs in a node.

-   The **ALF project** has a [new YouTube
   channel](https://gitpages.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ALF/ALF_Webpage/news/2022-08-02-youtube_channel/),
   along with a [new reference
   paper](https://gitpages.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ALF/ALF_Webpage/news/2022-08-30-new-alf-reference-paper/).

-   **QuTiP**
    -   Alex and Simon from the QuTiP admin team gave a short course on QuTiP at the Quantum Africa Summer School in Kigali, Rwanda. You can find the Jupyter book [here](https://hodgestar.github.io/qutip-asqsqis-2022/intro.html).

    -   Google Summer of Code student projects were completed,
       they are:

-   **QWorld** completed a 2-month long internship program,
   [QIntern2022](https://qworld.net/qintern-2022/), with 20
   projects, hosting 197 interns. New countries have joined the
   QCousins network. The [2nd Edition of the online introductory
   course](https://qworld.net/qcourse511-2/) on quantum
   computing and programming launched this quarter with more than 400
   participating students. The course is conducted via a
   collaboration with the Faculty of Computing, University of Latvia.
