Dear Unitary Fund community,

We are excited to share our 2023 Q2 quarterly update!

**unitaryHACK** **2023** arrived and wrapped up, thanks all for joining,
this was Unitary Fund\'s largest event to date: **over 750 participants
from 80+ countries, solving 99 bounties with awards of \$11k across 33
participating projects**. Thanks to all participants, maintainers and
sponsors (**AWS, Classiq and UF members**) for making this happen!

The community feedback for unitaryHACK has been amazing, with 44% of
hackers said they will continue with the projects they hacked on during
this event, and an additional 41% of hackers saying they would like to
continue making contributions if they have time. An estimated 60% of
hackers were making their first contributions to QOSS for this event.
Please read more about winners, stats and project information about the
event in **this blog post
[here](https://unitaryhack.dev/)**
co-authored by unitaryHACK director Nate Stemen.

We're also excited to announce the inauguration of [Unitary Fund
France](https://unitary.fund/posts/eu.html), Unitary Fund's first
European office. We've also welcomed Min, Srila and Ali as Summer
Interns.

We awarded **7 new grants** this quarter to fund new projects and enrich
existing projects of useful tooling for the quantum open source
ecosystem, ranging from TorchQuantum for quantum machine learning, to
stac, for quantum error correction, and also some follow up grants to
QWorld and HieraQcal.

Last quarter was a very busy time for **scientific research with
open-source tools by the Unitary Fund technical staff and our
collaborators**, with **three more papers** uploaded on arXiv: Misty
Wahl (UF tech staff) and co-authors at UF and the University of Chicago
upgraded quantum error mitigation with zero-noise extrapolation to
quantum error correction regime and fault tolerance in [this
paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14985).

Dan Strano (UF tech staff) and core contributors of the Qrack project,
with collaborators from UF, tuned up the capabilities of what is
possible to **simulate with a single GPU in terms of NISQ devices**, in
[this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14969). Both papers got
accepted as proceedings in IEEE Quantum Week! [In this
paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15863), researchers at Los
Alamos National Lab and Unitary Fund tech staff showed how quantum error
mitigation can be used to **increase with Mitiq the** **effective
quantum volume** of four IBM Quantum devices. Finally, we've written a
perspective on how to make quantum error mitigation practical sooner in
[this blog post](https://unitary.fund/posts/2023_qem.html).

**Mitiq** got a new **calibration** feature added, which you can read
more in [this blog post](https://unitary.fund/posts/calibration.html). You can use
some pre-built routines to pick the best quantum error mitigation
technique and parameters for your problem.

Thank you all for your continued support of the open-source quantum
ecosystem!

        > the quantum domain and the world together to network and
        > present their work. We hosted 9 invited speakers who shared

        > one.

-   **Qrack**

    -   The Qrack developers and Unitary Fund wrote the [first report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14969) 
        > on the design
        > of Qrack and its comparative benchmarks, publishing the report
        > on arXiv and ultimately being accepted into IEEE Quantum Week
        > proceedings for 2023. In the meantime, Qrack has begun to
        > experiment with and release \"hybrid stabilizer\" techniques
        > that can exactly and approximately simulate near-Clifford
        > circuits. These near-Clifford techniques can even be used for
        > circuit compilation, as opposed to only for simulation.

**Coming up this Quarter**

-   More [Quantum Wednesdays](https://unitary.fund/talks.html)!

    -   Jul 26th, Srila Palanikumar, "A review of Google Quantum's
    supremacy results"

    > welcome to join it!

-   UF tech staff will be at **IEEE Quantum Week** in Bellevue,
    > Washington, Sept 17-22! We'll give a Mitiq
