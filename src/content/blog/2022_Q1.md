To the Unitary Fund community,

We're excited to share our Q1 2022 quarterly update and highlight some
of what UF's been involved with so far this year.\
\
We continue to award new grants, update Mitiq, and add ambassadors,
advisors, technical staff and even new members to our program! For more
detailed information, have a read at our key highlights below.

As the year progresses, we remain committed to growing our support
towards the quantum open source ecosystem. Thank you all for your
continued support and being a part of our journey. Make sure to follow
our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/JqVGmpkP96),

-   Mitiq

    -   We released version 0.12 through 0.13 of Mitiq (full
        > [changelog](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html)):

        -   The 0.12 release contains a considerable overhaul of the
            > documentation organization and content (special thanks to
            > Misty Wahl and Purva Thakre!), [[check it
            > out]{.ul}](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/).

        -   The 0.13 release is compatible with the latest Cirq version
            > and contains GHZ circuit support (special thanks to Rahul
            > Mistri). Two design documents, on learning-based PEC and
            > digital dynamical decoupling were approved, thanks to
            > Misty Wahl and Aaron Robertson. Thanks \@astrojuanlu for
            > useful suggestions about readthedocs, as we improved the
            > HTML display of notebooks.

    -   The [[2022 Mitiq
        > roadmap]{.ul}](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/wiki#mitiq-2022-roadmap)
        > has been discussed and approved

    -   We added a [[Projects
        > Ideas]{.ul}](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/wiki/Project-Ideas)
        > section for students who may want to collaborate.

    -   The Unitary Fund team, together with collaborators at Johns
        > Hopkins, uploaded [[a
        > paper]{.ul}](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11792) with a study on
        > how to reduce the impact of correlated noise on zero noise
        > extrapolation.

    -   The Unitary Fund team uploaded [[a
        > paper]{.ul}](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05489) showing the
        > improvement of effective quantum volume with quantum error
        > mitigation, using Mitiq.

**News from UF Projects**

-   QuTiP has been accepted for Google Summer of Code 2022. Applications
    > for students open April 4th and close April 19th. Check out
    > [[current Project
    > Ideas]{.ul}](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2022).

-   Blog: [[Implementing a Variational Quantum Algorithms module in
    > QuTiP]{.ul}](https://unitary.fund/posts/vqa_in_qutip.html)

    -   QuTiP's qutip-qip package consists of classes QubitCircuit and
        > Gate, which simulate the dynamics of quantum circuits. For
        > VQAs, these gates should be parameterized. In addition to the
        > gate parameters, initialization options, which are fixed
        > throughout the optimization process, will be easily defined in
        > one object. For these purposes, we define two new classes,
        > VQABlock and VQA, which are abstractions on Gate and
        > QubitCircuit, respectively.

-   [[Two papers on quantum open source software
    > projects]{.ul}](https://unitary.fund/posts/pulser_qutip.html)
    > supported by the Unitary Fund were published in the open-access,
    > community-driven journal *Quantum*.

    -   The papers provide information on Pulser and qutip-qip, two
        > Python packages for the pulse-level simulation of quantum
        > programs on quantum computers.

-   Blog: [[OQuPy: Open Quantum Systems in
    > Python]{.ul}](https://unitary.fund/posts/2022_oqupy.html): A
    > Python 3 package to efficiently compute non-Markovian open quantum
    > systems.

    -   Additions to the OQuPy package with hopes that they would
        > further attract new users who might find some use of these in
        > their own research.

        -   Calculation of bath correlations from system correlations

        -   Non-perturbative simulation of a system coupled to multiple
            > environments

**Coming up next quarter:**

-   unitaryHACK is returning in June 2022: [[Register
    > Now!]{.ul}](https://airtable.com/shrJeycewBFqdot2B)
