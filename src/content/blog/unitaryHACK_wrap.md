Thanks to all that took part in unitaryHACK 2023; Unitary Fund's
distributed hackathon supporting existing projects in the quantum open
source ecosystem.

Whether you were a onlooker, maintainer, bounty hacker, or community
member: Thank you, it was a blast, and Unitary Fund's largest event to
date 💛🌴.

## Winners & Stats

Over **700 participants joined unitaryHACK 2023** **from over 80
countries** (!!) with a strong representation of India (30%) and the USA
(18%). Of these, 72 hackers claimed 99 bounties, with more than \$11k
awarded.

\[A considerable bump in participation from
[_2022_](https://2022.unitaryhack.dev/) that saw about 400 participants,
63 hacks and 27 hackers.\]

**Gregory Varghese**, aka WingCode completed 10 bounties, with **Davide
Gessa**, aka dakk following up with 9 bounties. A full leaderboard of
hacks is available [_here_](https://unitaryhack.dev/leaderboard/). In
the kick-off and wrap-up party on [**_Unitary Fund's
Discord_**](http://discord.unitary.fund/), over 70 enthusiasts joined
the celebrations.

This year 33 projects were featured, with the help of 45 maintainers!

These projects span a variety of languages such as **Python, Julia, Rust, C++, and Jupyter Notebooks**.
Project topics span from open hardware and diagnostics (KQCircuits, scqubits) to measurement based quantum computing (Graphix), from quantum error correction (Error Correction Zoo, QECFT book) to compilers (BQSKit, Mitiq), to quantum machine learning (HierarQcal, TorchQuantum, PennyLane, lambeq), from efficient quantum circuit simulators (qrack, Symmer, PyClifford, pauliopt) to analog quantum computing simulators (Bloqade, Pulser) to full-stack SDKs (Qiskit, Amazon Braket SDK, Yao), from projects orchestration and APIs (Covalent, Qiskit Braket Provider) to quantum information and nonlocal games (Toqito), from quantum network simulations (QuNetSim) to open quantum systems (QuTiP).

Of the hackers, 70% thought the challenges were just the right difficulty, with the remaining 30% saying they were too hard.
44% of hackers said they **will** continue to contribute to the projects they hacked on during this event, and an _additional_ 41% of hackers said they would like to continue making contributions if they have time.
An estimated 60% of hackers were making their first contributions to QOSS for this event, with many of them contributing to open source for the first time!
Congratulations to all for making such awesome contributions, it's really been wonderful to see!
