Dear Unitary Fund community,

We're excited to share our Q2 2022 quarterly update and highlight some
of what UF's been involved with so far this year.

We **launched
[Metriq](https://unitary.fund/posts/metriq_release.html)**, the
community-driven platform to benchmark quantum computing metrics. We
partnered with IQT Labs, USRA, RIKEN, the SQMS quantum research center,
Cambridge Quantum, Strangeworks, Agnostiq, Super.Tech, Quantonation, the
Quantum Computing Report and more organizations. Add and review
benchmarks at: [https://metriq.info/](https://metriq.info/)

**unitaryHack 2022**: our [quantum open source
hackathon](https://unitaryhack.dev/) rocked the quantum dev
community! We made distributed bounties to over 63 [merged pull
requests](https://unitaryhack.dev/bounties/) across 30 projects.
Read more in the blog post about [wrapping-up unitaryHACK
2022](https://unitary.fund/posts/2022_unitaryhack_wrapup.html).

As the year progresses, we remain committed to growing the quantum open
source ecosystem. Thank you all for your continued support. Make sure to

**New from Unitary Fund**

- **Metriq**: Read more about the announcement
    [here](https://unitary.fund/posts/metriq_release.html) from
    the Metriq team developers, Dan Strano and Vincent Russo

- **unitaryHACK** was a blast! You can find results on the [event
    page](https://unitaryhack.dev/results/).

- The Unitary Fund staff mentored Nick, Nyle, and Zhaoyi, three
    students from Stanford's CS59SI course, helping them getting
    started with quantum OSSS and contributing to Mitiq.

- Mitiq: We released version 0.14 through 0.17 of Mitiq (full
    [changelog](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html)):

    - In version 0.14 we focused on updating dependencies and making
        progress on two new features, dynamical decoupling and
        learning based error mitigation techniques. A number of high
        priority bugs and issues also were fixed.

    - In version 0.15 we focused on updating dependencies and making
        progress on two new features, dynamical decoupling and
        learning based PEC. For dynamical decoupling, high-level
        functions and rules were added. For learning-based PEC, a
        function calculating representations with a biased
        (combination of depolarizing and dephasing) noise model was
        added. Several high priority bugs and issues were also fixed.
        Special thanks to new contributors \@RubidgeCarrie and
        \@nickdgardner for their contributions to this release!

    - In version 0.16 we finalized the documentation of Digital
        Dynamical Decoupling. This is a major milestone, you can read
        more about this technique in this [blog
        post](https://unitary.fund/posts/2022_dynamical_decoupling_in_mitiq.html).

    - Version 0.17 was focused on unitaryHACK contributions.

- New manuscript co-authored by Unitary Fund's staff member, Vincent
    Russo, on "Arkhipov\'s theorem, graph minors, and linear system
    nonlocal games",
    [arXiv:2205.04645](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04645)

**New Grants**

- To **Haoxiang Wang** and **Min Li**, to develop a high-level API for
    variational quantum algorithm (VQA) training with quantum error
    mitigation.

- To **Matt Lourens**, to develop [Dynamic
    QCNN](https://github.com/matt-lourens/dynamic-qcnn), a tool
    to generate quantum convolutional neural network models
    programmatically.
