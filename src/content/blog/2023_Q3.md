Dear Unitary Foundation community,

We are excited to share our 2023 Q3 quarterly update!

The [**Quantum Open Source Software Survey 2023**](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QuantumSurvey2023) is
ongoing! Please take a couple of minutes to [take it
here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QuantumSurvey2023).

We have some exciting news on the research side: Unitary Foundation has been
[**awarded a
grant**](https://unitary.foundation/posts/2023_mitiq_nsf_pose/) by the
**National Science Foundation** to grow the open-source ecosystem for
Mitiq and enable a global community to adopt quantum error mitigation
out of the box. Unitary Foundation has been
[selected to participate in the Quantum for Bio program](https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/09/27/pasqal-and-qubit-pharmaceuticals-join-with-unitary-fund-to-win-wellcome-trusts-quantum-for-bio-program/)
by the **Wellcome Leap** to explore, with quantum startups PASQAL and Qubit Pharmaceuticals, biology-relevant applications with quantum
computing. We have [multiple open positions](https://unitary.foundation/careers/). 

Further on the research side, UF led the drafting of the [**first
review on open hardware in quantum
technology**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17233), with global
collaborators. The UF tech staff attended multiple events, including
IEEE Quantum Week in Bellevue, WA, the NYC Quantum Summit, and the GE
Climate, Sustainability and Quantum workshop in Albany, NY.

We launched our new Unitary Foundation
[**website**](https://unitary.foundation/): We have a [new blog
post](https://unitary.foundation/posts/2023_mitiq_stim_workflow/) on how
**Mitiq** can be used to lower the bounds of quantum error correction
(QEC), using Stim as a frontend.

We awarded **7 new grants** this quarter to fund new projects and enrich
existing projects of useful tooling for the quantum open source
ecosystem, ranging from open APIs to provide cloud access to atom-based
QPUs to expanding existing projects like Toqito.

**Mitiq** continues to grow, with new quantum error mitigation
techniques supported: quantum subspace expansion, Pauli Twirling, and
classical shadows -- and more tutorials.

Join the **IonQ Office Hours** on the [UF Discord](http://discord.unitary.foundation/), every Wednesday at 4pm ET. On the UF Discord you can join many quantum OSS community calls: Mitiq, Metriq, QIR Alliance, QICK, OpenQAOA, Covalent.   

Thank you all for your continued support of the open-source quantum
ecosystem!

**New from UF**

-   **Mitiq**

    -   New Releases: [v0.28.0](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/releases/tag/v0.28.0), [v.0.29](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/releases/tag/v0.29.0), [v.0.30](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/releases/tag/v0.30.0)

        -   **In v.0.28.0**: Quantum Subspace Expansion is now available in Mitiq! PEC Calibration contains some improvements and we added robust classical shadow estimation.

        -   **In v.0.29.0**: Update Pauli Twirling, Classical Shadows, Stim + Mitiq tutorial to merge error correction with error mitigation.

        -   **In v.0.30.0**: New documentation for the classical shadows technique, Pauli Twirling, and a tutorial applying both zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) and Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to quantum simulation, for the 1D Ising chain, in Cirq. We add functions for \"rotated\" randomized benchmarking (RB) quantum circuits, for more general benchmarks.

    -   Talks:

        -   UF tech staff was at **IEEE Quantum Week** in Bellevue, Washington, Sept 17-22! We gave a Mitiq [tutorial](https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2023/tutorials-program/), research talks and participated in an open science [workshop](https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2023/workshops-program/#overview-wks11).

-   **Metriq**

    -   [New site](https://metriq.info/) frontend, with tidier charts of major metrics like quantum volume visible already on the homepage. We performed a redefinition of Platforms, including major Providers and Devices.

-   **UF Research**

    -   \[2309.17233\] [Open Hardware in Quantum Technology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17233)

-   **New Grants**

    -   **QlassKit**: To **Davide Gessa** to develop [QlassKit](https://github.com/dakk/qlasskit), a Python library that allows developers to write classical algorithms in Python and translate them into unitary operators for use in quantum circuits.

    -   **labscript-qc**: To **Fred Jendrzejewski** to further develop [labscipt-qc](https://github.com/fretchen/labscript-qc), a software framework for cold atom research groups to make their experiments more accessible.

    -   **Toqito**: To **Purva Thakre** to grow [Toqito](https://github.com/purva-thakre), toward a mature open-source project and utilize it for further research in unextendible product bases.
