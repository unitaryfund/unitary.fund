The quantum computing landscape is rapidly evolving, with breakthroughs and advancements occurring regularly. However, amidst this progress, one challenge persists: how can researchers, developers, and enthusiasts effectively benchmark and compare different quantum computing platforms and technologies?
To address this challenge head-on, Unitary Fund is excited to announce the establishment of the Open Quantum Benchmark Committee. This committee will play a crucial role in furthering the development and adoption of quantum benchmarks to provide the community with a comprehensive and reliable framework for evaluating quantum computing systems.

The motivation behind the Open Quantum Benchmark Committee stems from the need to foster collaboration and standardization within the quantum computing community. By bringing together experts from various domains, including applications, compilers, error correction, hardware, and simulators, we aim to increase the size and improve the quality of the taxonomy captured by Metriq (https://metriq.info/), our community-driven quantum benchmarks platform, and empower researchers and developers with the tools they need to navigate the complex landscape of quantum computing benchmarks. 

Metriq (https://metriq.info/) is a free and open-source platform to facilitate quantum computing benchmarking. It gives researchers and developers a centralized hub to submit results, propose new benchmarking tasks, and access openly accessible data. By making benchmarking data explorable and live-updated, Metriq accelerates research and development in quantum technology. As a community member, you can go to https://metriq.info/ and contribute metrics from your own papers to increase the robustness of benchmarking data. 

Committee members will serve for one year, volunteering their time and expertise to attend quarterly meetings and support open-source and open-access quantum benchmarks. This is an open application process available to anyone in the public. To start, the committee will evaluate and decide on two metrics per topic found on the State of the Art Quantum Benchmarks page. 

We also acknowledge the invaluable contributions from other initiatives in this space, such as IEEE Quantum Benchmarks, QED-C STAC on Standards, BACQ, and events like the TQCI Seminar on Benchmarks for Quantum Computing, which collectively enrich the goals of standardized benchmarking across the field. 
The establishment of the Open Quantum Benchmark Committee represents a significant step towards advancing the field of quantum computing through collaboration and standardization. By leveraging the community's collective expertise and harnessing the power of platforms like Metriq, we can accelerate progress and unlock the full potential of quantum technology.

**AJ Rasmusson**
AJ Rasmusson is a graduate student at Indiana University doing trapped-ion research under Phil Richerme. This Summer, he’ll start a postdoc at the NIST Ion Storage Group, doing more ion trap experiments. In high school, his grandpa gifted him an audio lecture on quantum physics, and he’s been hooked ever since. He enjoys—and has greatly benefited from—open science endeavors, and he believe this philosophy is important for a vibrant scientific community. Outside of work, he enjoys wrangling his three kids, eating delicious food, 3D printing, and wandering the great outdoors.
