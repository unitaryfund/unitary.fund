Dear Unitary Foundation community,

We had a busy Q3 in 2024 and we are excited to share our highlights! This quarter we launched the third annual 2024 QOSS Survey. The annual survey is a state of the community & industry snapshot. It is a chance for anyone in the quantum computing industry to share their voice in the development of our field. The survey covers information on demographics, experience, community, research, tech stacks and more.

If you are a user or developer of software for any kind of quantum technology, we kindly encourage you to take this survey and contribute your voice to the future of quantum computing. Please note the survey will be available through the end of October 31, 2024. [**Take the survey here**](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/qosssurvey24).

This September we also wrapped up our second annual [unitaryCON](https://unitary.foundation/community/unitaryCON/), a collaborative workshop for the extended Unitary Foundation community. With the help of Dr. Alexandru Paler, unitaryCON 2024 was hosted at Aalto University in Espoo, Finland. UnitaryCON provided a unique opportunity for Unitary Foundation advisors, grantees, staff, ambassadors and friends to gather, talk, learn, and share ideas about how to move the field forward. With an event rating of 9.36 out of 10, the event was a success in bringing the community together to learn and network. Read more about the event and find links to talk information and slides [here](https://unitary.foundation/posts/2024_unitarycon/). 

We look forward to another exciting quarter to close out 2024, and thank you to all of our community members for the impactful contributions to the open source quantum ecosystem in Q3!

## New from Unitary Foundation 

**Unitary Foundation Research**: [W. J. Zeng](https://arxiv.org/search/quant-ph?searchtype=author&query=Zeng,+W+J), [F. Labib](https://arxiv.org/search/quant-ph?searchtype=author&query=Labib,+F), [V. Russo](https://arxiv.org/search/quant-ph?searchtype=author&query=Russo%2C+V), *Towards violations of Local Friendliness with quantum computers*. arXiv preprint (2024), [[2409.15302](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15302)]

**Mitiq**

[v0.39.0](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/releases/tag/v0.39.0): updates to our documentation, beginning with the completion of the first section of the Pauli Twirling user guide, which offers a comprehensive introduction to this feature. Additionally, we've added a new tutorial on CDR (Clifford Data Regression) using [Qrack](https://github.com/unitaryfund/qrack/) as an efficient near-Clifford simulator.

**Metriq**

- This quarter we added two new members to the [Open Quantum Benchmark Committee](https://unitary.foundation/posts/2024_benchmark_committee/), Ed Younis and Peter Groszkowski. Ed is a computer systems engineer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with extensive experience developing and implementing advanced algorithms for quantum compilation, such as QFAST and Qfactor. He is currently the principal engineer on the BQSKit project and has research interests in quantum synthesis, compilation, and software systems. Peter is a researcher at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory working in various areas of physics, with emphasis on topics related to quantum computing and information. Beyond physics, he is also interested in all aspects of software development, ranging from numerical simulations to instrumentation control. Peter is a strong advocate of the open-source development model, supporting it whenever possible.
- Work is being done to create state of the art metrics for benchmarking: https://metriq.info/Sota

**Catalyst**

Unitary Foundation and Xanadu have partnered to enhance the error mitigation features of Catalyst, a powerful package for just-in-time (JIT) compilation of PennyLane programs. With this collaboration, Catalyst now includes support for exponential fitting and local folding within its zero-noise extrapolation routines, further boosting its capabilities.

This marks Unitary Foundation’s first venture into the domain of quantum just-in-time compilation and its initial exploration of the MLIR compiler framework. It was an exciting opportunity to tap into the potential of integrating error mitigation directly within the MLIR stack and to experiment with cutting-edge quantum compilation technologies. More about this in a dedicated blog post coming out soon. 

**IEEE Quantum Week in review**

Unitary Foundation had a great presence at IEEE Quantum Week in Montreal, Canada this year! 

IEEE Quantum week workshop ([Quantum Software 2.0](https://sites.google.com/view/quantum-software-2-0)) that was a collaboration between ORNL, Xanadu, Unitary Foundation, and AWS

Co-authored by Unitary Foundation, IBM, and Quantinuum, [Effective DEIA Requires Accountability](https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2024/program/panels-abstracts/#pan10) was a panel discussion at IEEE Quantum Week to discuss strategies for accountability in building diversity in the quantum computing field.
