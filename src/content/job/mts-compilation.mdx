title: Member of Technical Staff - Quantum Compilers, Full Time, Remote
---
Posted on September 16th, 2024. 

Full-time role. Fully remote (overlap with PT/ET/CET zones preferred.)

Unitary Fund is a non-profit research group helping build a quantum technology industry that benefits the most people. We support the community, e.g., running a grant program to support the development of new open source quantum software, and we do our own research and technology development for the ecosystem.
Through this project you’ll be at the center of the emerging field of quantum technology and working to develop new and critical components to accelerate it.

## Role Details  - Member of the Technical Staff, Quantum Compilers
We’re hiring a Member of Technical Staff to lead Unitary Fund software projects focused on quantum compilation. You will be part of a team developing software and performing research as part of sponsored research projects led by Unitary Fund, in collaboration with key players from the industry and research sector.
You and your team will develop and extend open source quantum compilers targeted at the next generation of quantum computers currently underdevelopment. These compilers will include gate optimization, routing, error-mitigation, and error-correction capabilities over time. This builds on the work we have already developed in our error-mitigating compiler Mitiq (https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq) as well as many other open software projects in the ecosystem. You will adapt the compiler to run usefully on many different quantum hardware platforms.
This role encompasses work across technical and product-oriented aspects of the project and will require a creative and organized individual to surface priorities, triage needs, communicate continuously, and know when to ask for help. This position will work closely with Unitary Fund leadership and have opportunities to develop their own leadership as well. 

## RESPONSIBILITIES
### Product Ownership
You will manage the development of Unitary Fund quantum compilers. You will need to independently manage tasks and coordinate with leaders to identify priorities, troubleshoot issues, develop a strategy for the product growth and work closely with the other technical staff working on the technical aspects.

### Feature Development 
You will work with the technical team to design and develop a quantum compiler toolchain that everyone wants to use.

### Community Growth
Support the product and related projects, growing the community of users and contributors.  

## SKILLS & QUALIFICATIONS
We will expect you have 2+ years of paid or voluntary experience relevant to:
- Software engineering work experience (not necessarily quantum related) OR 2+ years of research experience in quantum information such as in a PhD program
- Track record of building and launching software that other people use with small teams
- Excited to make quantum technologies better, easier, and more accessible

## Bonuses: 
- Experience in C/C++ Development and/or Python Development
- Interest/Knowledge in Quantum Computing, Quantum Algorithms or Quantum Information
- Relevant Studies (Degree/Ph.D.) in Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics, Engineering or similar
- Likely to have prior experience in computer science, scientific computation, academic research or commercial software engineering focused positions
- Track record of building and launching software that other people use with small teams
- Excited to make quantum technologies better, easier, and more accessible


## WORK HOURS & BENEFITS
**Flexible Hours** - We are happy to accommodate complex schedules or limitations, and care more about the work getting done than the times you’re sitting at your computer.

**Alignment** - Being a small team, we will be seeking a collaborator who aligns with our culture, we would love for it to be a delight to work together.

**Whole Self** - Our team is made up of smart, caring humans who take time to know one another personally and cater to individual needs or perspectives.

**Remote** - We work remotely, across many time zones.

**International** - We work globally with many cultures and institutions.
(for US employees) - full 401k plan and healthcare benefits
