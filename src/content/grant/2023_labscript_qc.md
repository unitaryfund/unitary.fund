To **Fred Jendrzejewski** to develop an SDK that allows cold atom research groups to make their experiments more accessible. The project has been merged with the **[sqooler](https://github.com/Alqor-UG/sqooler)** package such that theorists and experimentalists have a common framework. Beta testers are welcome to test examples for [hardware control](https://github.com/Alqor-UG/labscript-qc-example) and [simulators](https://github.com/Alqor-UG/sqooler-example).
