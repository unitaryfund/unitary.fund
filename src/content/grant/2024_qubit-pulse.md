To **[Mattias Fitzpatrick[(https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattias-fitzpatrick-8b53a9102/)** to further develop **[Qubit-Pulse: An educational qubit pulse engineering game](https://github.com/mvwf/qublitz)**, a pulse simulator game that takes in drive amplitudes as a function of time and produces the qubit state in the Bloch sphere to allow users to simulate different Hamiltonians and controls.
