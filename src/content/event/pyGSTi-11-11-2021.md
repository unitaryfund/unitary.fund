## About the talk

In this talk, we will present pyGSTi, a python package for generating and analyzing quantum characterization, verification, and validation experiments, with particular focus on gate set tomography and scalable forms of randomized benchmarking. pyGSTi has been used to characterize and improve quantum hardware performance across a wide variety of platforms, including trapped ion, superconducting transmon, and silicon spin qubit devices. We will discuss the motivation behind pyGSTi, explore the functionality of and interplay between its basic objects, and provide several demonstrations of the code in action. These demonstrations will span a variety of examples, from high-level analyses which require minimal pyGSTi knowledge to more complex use cases which can fully leverage pyGSTi’s broad capabilities.

  
## About the speaker

Erik and Kenneth both are researchers and developers working on pyGSTi at Sandia National Labs.
