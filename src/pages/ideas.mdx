# Project Inspiration

Looking for inspiration? This section contains links that might inspire new Unitary Fund projects.

Unitary Fund is supporting the development of [QuTiP](http://www.qutip.org/), the Quantum Toolbox in Python. Interested students can apply to propose a code project in QuTiP and be mentored by the core developers for a 3-month period, working remotely, similarly to the Google Summer of Code. A list of [project ideas](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2020) is available from the QuTiP wiki. Applications are open all-year-round.

[Cassandra Granade](https://www.cgranade.com/) - a UF Advisory Board member and senior developer on Microsoft's open source [Quantum Development Kit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/quantum/development-kit) - has some suggestions:

- Additional Q# simulators (e.g.: open systems or CHP simulators)
- New language interoperability; currently, can call into Q# from Python, C#, F#, VB.NET, or PowerShell
- Visualization and/or debugger tools (e.g.: improving the state visualizer sample)
- New libraries for quantum algorithms (e.g.: we've gotten requests for [QRAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1879) implementations and a [Durr-Hoyer library)](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9607014)

[Travis Scholten](http://travisscholten.com/) - an Advisory Board member from [IBM Quantum](https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/) - suggests:

- Some of the larger issues in Qiskit Terra labelled as "[short projects](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/labels/short%20project)."
- Implementing the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm for approximating a given unitary by gates from a finite set, to arbitrary accuracy.
- Writing a simulator for parameterized quantum circuits, leveraging the Qiskit Parameter object.
- Building an encoder and decoder for quantum expander codes. (References [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00822), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03821), and [here](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~madhusudan/courses/Spring2017/scribe/lect13.pdf).)

[Michał Stęchły](https://unitary.fund/www.mustythoughts.com) \- an Advisory Board member from [Zapata Computing](https://www.zapatacomputing.com/) - shares his ideas:

- Visualization tools for high-dimension optimization landscapes could help get better insight into algorithms like QAOA or VQE. [Orqviz](https://github.com/zapatacomputing/orqviz) is our attempt to tackle this issue, but contributions / other attempts would be welcome.
- At QOSF we have done [evaluation of open source projects](https://qosf.org/evaluation/) in quantum in 2018. Help with updating and automating the process would be appreciated.
- Many QC-related projects are scientifically solid, but lack on the software engineering side - murky architecture, lack of tests, versioning, CICD, etc. I believe improving the quality of the software could greatly benefit the community.
