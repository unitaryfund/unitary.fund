</SolidHeading>

<ReducedWidth>

On Wednesdays at 5:30PM UTC the Unitary Fund hosts "Quantum Wednesday" (QW). The event is an hour long and generally pertains to quantum computing related topics. The main types of events are:

- Invited speaker
- Paper review
- Focussed discussion/forum
- Social coding
- Mitiq office hours

The events are hosted on our :social-link-discord[Discord], and are open for all to attend, regardless of quantum computing knowledge/skill. We encourage questions, and engagement from community members, but listening in is also completely acceptable. Hope to see you there!
