  <NumberPoints title="We do three main things">
    1. ### Microgrants
        We run a microgrant program to fund explorers across the world to work on quantum technologies. Do you have an idea for a project?
        
        [Apply for a microgrant.](https://unitaryfund.typeform.com/to/j0kAOd?typeform-source=unitary.foundation)<br />
        See our [FAQ](/faqs) and [previous grants](/grants).

    2.  ### Research
        We do our own research to help the ecosystem as a whole. For example, we are developing [(1)mitiq](/research/mitiq), an open source compiler for error-mitigated quantum programming, and [(2)metriq](/research/metriq), an open community platform for sharing quantum tech benchmarks.

    3.  ### Community
        We host an open source quantum tech community that runs [hackathons](https://unitaryhack.dev) and events on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/JqVGmpkP96). Have a look at our [Calendar.](community/events) Want to join our team? [We're hiring!](careers)
