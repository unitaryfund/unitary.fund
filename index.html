        The Unitary Fund is a grant program run by <a href="http://twitter.com/wjzeng">Will Zeng</a>.
        It funds explorers across the world to work on open source quantum computing. <br><br>

        The program gives <b>$2k</b> cash grants for projects to develop open source quantum software for
        near term hybrid quantum-classical programming. It is designed to be as simple as possible. No committees to
        convince. No organizational affiliation required. Just a short form and a two minute video.<br><br>

        The Unitary Fund is designed to help the quantum industry, in a small way, to cross the chasm.

        If you want to learn more about why and how to program quantum computers, then I'd recommend this introductory

    <p class="subtitle">F.A.Q.</p>

    <p class="blocktext">
        <b>Q: Can anyone apply?</b> <br>
        Yes - any age, any country, no credentials required.<br><br>

        <b>Q: What type of project qualifies?</b> <br>
        Any project that will benefit humanity that leverages near-term quantum computing. Open source is not a
        dogmatic requirement - though we would recommend Apache 2. It is, however, important to see a rationale for any
         exceptions (for example if you think it'd be best for the world to reserve the IP for a company).<br><br>

        <b>Q: What do I get if I win?</b> <br>
        I'll give you 50% up front. I'll check in with you during the project before sending the second half. Then
        I'll do a follow-up phone call and/or email at the end to hear how it went. Payment will come by Paypal, wire
        transfer or Bitcoin. <br>

        I'll publish a list of all the winners on <a href="http://unitary.fund">unitary.fund</a> after they've been
        selected. At completion I'll ask you to write a short summary of the project that can be posted online.<br>

        During the project, you don't need to make regular reports on your progress (though I'd be happy to hear
        from you). <br><br>

        <b>Q: What are the key dates?</b> <br>
        There are no key dates! Applications are rolling until all grant money has been allocated. <br><br>

        <b>Q: What kind of projects are you looking for?</b> <br>
        Quantum computing is a nascent field, so I'm open-minded. Your project can be:
    </p>
    <ul class="blocktext">
        <li>contributing to an existing open source project</li>
        <li>creating a new framework or tool</li>
        <li>researching a new algorithm</li>
        <li>applying an existing algorithm to a new problem</li>
        <li>creating or curating a free dataset that others can use</li>
        <li>educating, explaining, or otherwise helping people learn new or existing techniques</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="blocktext">
        …or anything else that feels like it would help make quantum computing useful faster.<br><br>

        <b>Q: How will you select the winners?</b> <br>
        I'm looking for smart people with interesting ideas that could be useful to the world. I'll pay extra
        attention to projects that seem like they won't get funded another way. <br><br>

        <b>Q: I have a job. Can I still apply?</b> <br>
        Yes! Anyone can apply. You just need to make sure that you don't conflict with any IP contract you've signed
        with your employer. <br><br>

        <b>Q: Can teams apply?</b> <br>
        Yes. Multiple people can apply together as a team. Please fill out a single application, but provide background
        information for each person in the team. You should designate a lead person to coordinate the application as
        well as receive and distribute/spend the money. <br><br>

        <b>Q: Can I apply multiple times?</b> <br>
        Yes, you can apply as often as you like. You can only win once.<br><br>

        <b>Q: I love this idea and I want to help! Can I provide additional funding, datasets, mentorship, or help
            reviewing applications?</b> <br>
        Yes! Thank you for being awesome! If you want to contribute in any way, please email me at
        <a href="mailto:sponsorship@unitary.fund">sponsorship@unitary.fund</a>.<br><br>

        <b>Q: Are there any strings attached?</b> <br>
        The money is a gift. It's not an equity investment or loan, and I won't own any of your intellectual property.
        My only request is that you think about how to pay it forward to others.<br><br>


        <b>Q: Where did you get the idea to do this?</b> <br>
        This program is inspired by, and directly borrows from
        <a href="https://twitter.com/natfriedman">Nat Friedman</a> and
        <a href="https://twitter.com/danielgross">Daniel Gross</a> and their
        <a href="https://aigrant.org/">AI Grant Program</a>.
        Thanks, Nat and Daniel! <br> <br>
        That program is inspired by, and directly borrows many elements from
        <a href="https://twitter.com/nayafia">Nadia Eghbal</a> and her
        <a href="https://medium.com/@nayafia/5-000-no-strings-attached-9e7b95d33e50">no-strings-attached
        grant program</a>. Thanks, Nadia!
