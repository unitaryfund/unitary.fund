                <p>Unitary Fund is a 501(c)(3) non-profit working to create a quantum technology ecosystem that benefits the most people. We run a grant program to support new open source quantum tech, and we fund our own research on key projects for the
                    ecosystem.
                </p>
                <p>We’re hiring for a part-time marketing and communications role on our team.</p>
                <p>This opening is a rare opportunity to contribute to the developing quantum technology ecosystem. Given the breadth of Unitary Fund’s work, the person who will succeed in this role will contribute to marketing materials and campaigns that
                    help us promote our mission, and collect feedback from the community to help us do more. This role encompasses work across multiple aspects of the organization (microgrants and Unitary Labs) and will require a strongly organized individual
                    to surface priorities, triage needs, communicate continuously, and know when to ask for help. This position will work closely with the operations and community leadership.</p>
                <p>This is a part-time role, likely 8-12 hours per week, however we are open to discussing what works for the right candidate.</p>
                <p>Unitary Fund is a fully remote team and this role is also remote.</p>
