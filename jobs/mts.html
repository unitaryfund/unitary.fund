                <p><a href="https://unitary.fund/">Unitary Fund</a> is a non-profit research group helping build a quantum technology industry that benefits the most people. We support the community, e.g. running a grant program to support the development
                    of new open source quantum software, and we do our own research on key projects for the ecosystem.
