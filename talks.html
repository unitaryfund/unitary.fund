                                        <p> Random numbers are everywhere. Computer algorithms, data encryption, physical simulations, and even the arts use them all the time. There is one problem though: it turns out that they are actually very difficult
                                            to produce in large amounts. Luckily, the probabilistic nature of quantum computers makes these devices particularly useful for the task. QRAND introduces a versatile interface layer between NumPy and several
                                            quantum computing platforms (qiskit, cirq, qsharp...), along with some useful functionality that enables the production of quantum random numbers (QRN) according to different quantum protocols, and for a wide
                                            variety of probability distributions.</p>

                                        <p> In this talk, we will present pyGSTi, a python package for generating and analyzing quantum characterization, verification, and validation experiments, with particular focus on gate set tomography and scalable forms
                                            of randomized benchmarking. pyGSTi has been used to characterize and improve quantum hardware performance across a wide variety of platforms, including trapped ion, superconducting transmon, and silicon spin
                                            qubit devices. We will discuss the motivation behind pyGSTi, explore the functionality of and interplay between its basic objects, and provide several demonstrations of the code in action. These demonstrations
                                            will span a variety of examples, from high-level analyses which require minimal pyGSTi knowledge to more complex use cases which can fully leverage pyGSTi’s broad capabilities.</p>

                                        <p> The manipulation of neutral atoms by light is at the heart of countless scientific discoveries in the field of quantum physics in the last three decades. The level of control that has been achieved at the single
                                            particle level within arrays of optical traps, while preserving the fundamental properties of quantum matter (coherence, entanglement, superposition), makes these technologies prime candidates to implement disruptive
                                            computation paradigms. In this talk, I will present <a href="https://github.com/pasqal-io/Pulser">pulser</a>, a recently developed open-source python framework enabling practitioners to control those devices
                                            at the pulse level.</p>

                                            processors powered by arrays of single atoms. Since then, he has been heading the quantum software developments.

                                        <p><a href="http://qutip.org/">QuTiP</a>: A quantum toolbox in Python, is one of the most popular tools to simulate open quantum systems – but it has expanded beyond that over the years. It is a simple but powerful
                                            library that, used by students, researchers, engineers, is having a tremendous impact on quantum science research. QuTiP is also Unitary Fund’s first affiliated project. In this talk, I will introduce the library
                                            and take the example of some new developments in QuTiP to show the ease with which one can simulate open quantum systems as well as contribute to the development of such open-source software tools to promote
                                            reproducibility and therefore accelerate the adoption of a particular simulation technique across the research community.</p>

                                        <p>We present <strong><a href="https://qcor.ornl.gov/">qcor</a></strong> - a language extension to C++ and compiler implementation that enables heterogeneous quantum-classical programming, compilation, and execution
                                            in a single-source context. Our work provides a first-of-its-kind C++ compiler enabling high-level quantum kernel (function) expression in a quantum-language agnostic manner, as well as a hardware-agnostic,
                                            retargetable compiler workflow targeting a number of physical and virtual quantum computing backends. qcor leverages novel Clang plugin interfaces and builds upon the <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/xacc">
                                            XACC</a> system-level quantum programming framework to provide a state-of-the-art integration mechanism for quantum-classical compilation that leverages the best from the community at-large. qcor translates
                                            quantum kernels ultimately to the XACC intermediate representation, and provides user-extensible hooks for quantum compilation routines like circuit optimization, analysis, and placement. This work details the
                                            overall architecture and compiler workflow for qcor, and provides a number of illuminating programming examples demonstrating its utility for near-term variational tasks, quantum algorithm expression, and feed-forward
                                            error correction schemes.</p>

                                            hardware platforms. It has 0 required external software dependencies besides C++11 standard, it optionally supports OpenCL accelerators back to the v1.1 standard, including multi-accelerator operation, and it
                                            prides itself on its "novel optimization layer." The speaker will outline the many features of the framework, including the theory behind the novel optimization layer, culminating in a simulator stack whose
                                            general use case is also its highest performance "Swiss Army knife" simulator, which has been integrated with a much wider developing quantum open source stack via plugins. Quantitative benchmarks will also
                                            be discussed, including performance on the quantum Fourier transform and an example of a "quantum volume"-type random universal circuit.

                                over $2K in bounties for tagged issues in quantum open source projects for folks that made maintainer-approved pull requests to a list of selected quantum open source projects. All participants got digital swag when they
                                made approved Pull Requests (PR)s, and random participants that made 1 quality Pull Request (PR)s got a swag pack in the mail.
