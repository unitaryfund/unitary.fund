To the Unitary Fund community,

Hope that you all are having a welcome start to 2022. In this quarterly
newsletter we'll take a look back at some highlights from the last
quarter of last year.

In addition to new grants and updates to mitiq, we're proud to have
enabled, together with QOSF, the 2021 edition of the [[Wittek
Prize]{.ul}](http://wittekprize.com/). Look out to hear about the winner
soon!

Also be on the lookout for our 2021 Annual Report, which will summarize
updates from our programs and community from the whole of last year.

We continue to work hard to support the development of a vibrant, open
quantum technology ecosystem. Thanks to all of you who have joined us in
this mission.

-   **New from Unitary Fund**

    -   Alwoina Yap and Frances Poblete have joined the Unitary Fund
        > team to help us improve and scale our marketing and
        > communications reach.

    -   About **Mitiq**:

        -   We released [[version]{.ul}](https://opencollective.com/)
            > 0.11.1 of Mitiq, adding PennyLane support

        -   The Mitiq integration with PennyLane is featured on the
            > [[PennyLane
            > blog]{.ul}](https://pennylane.ai/blog/2021/11/error-mitigation-with-mitiq-and-pennylane/)!

        -   Andrea Mari gave a recorded [[Qiskit Seminar on
            > Mitiq]{.ul}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK3Vkn2MCCg).

    -   Our paper on extending probabilistic error cancellation got
        > published in Phys. Rev. A.
        > ([[arXiv:2108.02237]{.ul}](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02237)).

    -   We hosted two [[Quantum Software
        > Talks]{.ul}](https://unitary.fund/talks.html) (check out the
        > videos, the talks are great!):

        -   Pedro Riveiro spoke about QRAND, a library for quantum

        -   The PyGSTi team spoke about this Python tool for noise
            > characterization

    -   We attended [[Q2B]{.ul}](https://q2b.qcware.com/) with a booth
        > and a talk by Sarah Kaiser. Thanks to our ambassador Misty
        > Wahl who also volunteered to attend and represent Unitary
        > Fund!

    -   Sarah Kaiser is a 2021 Python Software Foundation
        > [[Fellow]{.ul}](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/01/announcing-python-software-foundation.html).
