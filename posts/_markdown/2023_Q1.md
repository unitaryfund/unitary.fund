Dear Unitary Fund community,

We are excited to share our quarterly update and highlight UF's
activities for last year in the recently released [2022 Annual
Report](https://unitary.fund/posts/2022.html): Check it out for
lots of interesting content on microgrants, testimonials, stats and
details on software and research from the past year.

Reminder: **unitaryHACK** 2023 is coming May 26-June 13th! **Sign up
here**!

Last quarter we announced the [2023 cohort of Unitary Fund
members](https://unitary.fund/posts/2023_members.html): as core
members, IBM Quantum and Scientifica Venture Capital, and as supporting
members, [Agnostiq](https://www.covalent.xyz/),
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/),
[Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/),
[Dorahacks](https://dorahacks.io/),
[Pasqal](https://www.pasqal.com/),
[Quandela](https://www.quandela.com/), and
[Qyber](https://www.qyber.ai/). Thanks to their leadership, and
the generosity of our other supporters, UF can continue its mission of
cultivating the quantum open source ecosystem.

We continue to update Metriq and have implemented an automatic API to
run quantum computing benchmarks, as defined by the QED-C consortium.
You can read more about it in
[this](https://unitary.fund/posts/2023_metriq_qedc.html) blog
post.

Mitiq got some nice updates in its documentation and with a new
quantum-error-mitigation calibration module that makes it easier to
choose the right parameter to apply.

We awarded grants to enrich existing projects of useful tooling, such as
OpenQAOA and the Qiskit transpiler, and funded
[Graphix](https://github.com/TeamGraphix/graphix), the first UF
grant supporting the simulation of measurement-based quantum computing.

Thank you all for your continued support of the open-source quantum
ecosystem!
