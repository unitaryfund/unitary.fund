                                <p>Over the past few years, interest in the field of quantum computing has grown dramatically, especially in communities of high school students! While lots of quantum-related educational material is scattered around the Internet,
                                    it is oftentimes difficult to find curated, accessible, and high-quality resources. This blog post aims to (hopefully) provide a comprehensive list of quantum computing-related resources and opportunities for high-schoolers.
                                    For some context, I just graduated from high school, and have been interested in quantum computing for about two years now. I have a lot of personal experience self-studying the field, and I have used/participated in
                                    some of the resources listed below!</p>
                                <p dir="ltr">
                                    <p>Unfortunately, many of the programs that will be discussed have already closed their registration, or have already concluded for this year. However, many will likely end up taking place annually, so be sure to keep
                                        an eye out for any announcements or further information about next year’s cohorts!</p>

                                                    That being said, you will <em>not</em> have enough background to go get a job after this course! You'll be able to understand what quantum computing is, and know where to go if you want to learn more.</p>

                                        <p dir="ltr">The best personal advice that I can give to a quantum-curious high school student is to be active in the learning process. Absorbing information through reading/listening/watching is great, but to gain an even greater
                                            depth of understanding, it is very important to engage the material through critical thinking and problem solving. A fantastic way to "engage" when learning about quantum computing is to use the amazing quantum
                                            software tools that exist, like <a href="https://qiskit.org/">Qiskit</a>, <a href="http://docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/">Forest</a>,
                                            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/quantum/development-kit">Q#</a>,
                                            <a href="https://pennylane.ai/">PennyLane</a>, <a href="https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Cirq</a>, and more, to simulate different quantum algorithms. You can even run your algorithm on real quantum devices
                                            <a href="https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/">for
                                        free</a>! The courses and resources above are all amazing, and convey ideas with great clarity and accessibility. If you combine this with building things, solving tough
                                            problems, and maybe even simulating a few quantum circuits, not only will you learn more, but you’ll have much more fun while doing it!
