                                <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
                                <p>I’m an undergraduate student at the University of Sydney, studying Physics and Computer Science. I’ve worked on a few quantum computing projects in the past, and was really excited to be awarded a microgrant by the Unitary Fund to work on this project.</p>
                                <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
                                <p>Many groundbreaking quantum algorithms (Shor’s, Grover’s, etc) require quantum computers with a large number of qubits and high fault-tolerance to produce useful output for non-trivial problem instances. While this is likely some time away, there exist algorithms that aim to leverage the current power of noisy intermediate–scale quantum (NISQ) systems. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a hybrid classical-quantum type of algorithm in which parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are optimized, with an objective function being evaluated on quantum hardware, and the parameter update occurring on a classical machine.</p>
                                <p>One current area of interest in VQAs is that of the “initialization” for the algorithm. Problems are described by a quantum circuit, with its structure based on a circuit ansatz - usually inspired by the problem one wishes to solve. The initial conditions for the parameters of the circuit, as well as the circuit structure itself, heavily influence the performance of the algorithm. It is therefore worthwhile to have the tools to test VQA formulations on a classical simulation of a quantum system, before expending time and resources to apply it on real quantum hardware.</p>
                                <p><code>QuTiP</code> is a open-source <code>python</code> library for simulating quantum systems. In this project, I designed and wrote an implementation of a <code>VQA</code> module for <code>QuTiP</code> which allows users to define and evaluate the effectiveness of VQAs on their local machines.</p>
                                <h2 id="module-overview">Module Overview</h2>
                                <p>At the base level, we’re dealing with quantum circuits, which are made up of quantum gates. In <code>QuTiP</code>, there exist classes — <code>QubitCircuit</code> and <code>Gate</code> — which simulate the dynamics of quantum circuits.</p>
                                <p>For VQAs, we now want these gates to be parameterized. In addition to the gate parameters, we want initialization options, which are fixed throughout the optimization process, to be easily defined in one object. For these purposes, we define two new classes which are abstractions on <code>Gate</code> and <code>QubitCircuit</code>, respectively.</p>
                                <h3 id="the-vqa_block-class">The VQA_Block class</h3>
                                <p>The <code>VQA_Block</code> class encapsulates one component of our circuit. Within it could be the action of one or more quantum gates. It can hold parameters, or keep note of how many free parameters it needs as input to be translated into a gate on the quantum circuit.</p>
                                <p>In quantum computing, all quantum gates can be described by unitary operators. Our <code>VQA_Block</code> class has a method that will generate a unitary operator for the quantum circuit; but crucially, the value of this operator can change based on the parameters the <code>VQA_Block</code> receives.</p>
                                <p>The <code>VQA_Block</code> holds information about the operator it can generate, the parameters it needs, and methods to compute derivates of its operator — so that the algorithm can compute gradients of its cost function. The optimization process is thus a loop in which <code>VQA_Block</code>s are evaluated to inform the optimization of the cost of a circuit, and their parameters are updated to decrease this cost.</p>
                                <h3 id="the-vqa-class">The VQA class</h3>
                                <p>The <code>VQA</code> class holds information about the problem being optimized, and has callable methods to run optimization procedures with various options, such as the number of qubits required, the number of layers — or repetitions — of the circuit, and the optimization method to use.</p>
                                <p>One part of the optimization process is specifying a “cost function” which the optimizer can use to determine how good a particular parameter set is. In the case of a real quantum computer, the only output we have comes from taking measurements of the system. In quantum computing, these are usually represented as “bitstrings”, which encode the measurement outcome. For example, the measurement outcome of a two qubit system with one qubit measured in the |0&gt; state, and another in the |1&gt; state can be represented by the bitstring |01&gt;.</p>
                                <p>If the cost method is set to <code>BITSTRING</code>, then the user needs to provide a function that takes in this string of 1’s and 0’s, and returns the associated cost.</p>
                                <p>Because we’re performing a quantum simulation, we don’t just have to deal with measurements — we can “peak under the hood” of the simulation and get more information, such as the actual state of the system before measurement. With this, we allow two more methods for specifying a cost.</p>
                                <p>If the cost method is set to <code>STATE</code>, then the user can provide a function that takes in a quantum state and returns a cost.</p>
                                <p>If the cost method is set to <code>OBSERVABLE</code>, then the user can provide an observable - and the cost becomes the expectation value of that observable in the final state of the circuit.</p>
                                <p>The <code>VQA</code> class stores a list of <code>VQA_Block</code> instances, and can perform an optimization of their free parameters with a number of different options.</p>
                                <p>By allowing <code>VQA_Block</code> instances to take more complicated structures and custom functions which generate their unitaries, we also allow a range of quantum control problems to be approached within the framework of a PQC. One such abstraction is the <code>Parameterized_Hamiltonian</code> class, which can sit in <code>VQA_Block</code> within the circuit. We have used this to explore, for example, optimizing a circuit for dynamical decoupling (<a href="https://github.com/EnBr55/qutip-vqa-examples/">code available here</a>). A more general example in which we solve a combinatorial problem using VQAs is detailed below.</p>
                                <h2 id="example">Example</h2>
                                <p>Here we will look at how one might implement a VQA in this module. To begin, we’ll introduce the <code>partition</code> problem.</p>
                                <p>The <code>partition</code> problem asks if there is a way to partition a set <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> = [<em>s</em><sub>0</sub>,<em>s</em><sub>1</sub>,…<em>s</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>]</span>, of integers, in to two subsets <span class="math inline"><em>S</em>1</span> and <span class="math inline"><em>S</em>2</span> such that the sum of elements in each of these sets is equal. For example, the set <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> = [1,4,3]</span> can be partitioned into the sets <span class="math inline"><em>S</em>1 = [1,3]</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>S</em>2 = [4]</span>. The optimization version of this algorithm asks for the partitioning that minimizes the difference in these two sums.</p>
                                <p>This problem is known to be NP-Hard, so there is no known efficient classical algorithm for solving it. One way of finding approximate solutions to this, and other combinatorial problems is through a VQA known as the “quantum approximation optimization algorithm” (QAOA).</p>
                                <p>Without addressing the theory behind QAOA, it gives us a circuit ansatz that we can use to approximate solutions combinatorial problems. In general, if we can encode the solution to our problem in the ground state of a Hamiltonian, <span class="math inline"><em>H</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></span>, and we can pick another Hamiltonian, <span class="math inline"><em>H</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span> that doesn’t commute with <span class="math inline"><em>H</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></span>, then our circuit takes the form:</p>
                                <p><span class="math display"><em>U</em>(<em>β</em>,<em>γ</em>) = ∏<sup><em>p</em></sup>​<sub><em>j</em> = 0</sub>  <em>e</em><sup>−<em>i</em><em>β</em><sub><em>j</em></sub><em>H</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></sup><em>e</em><sup>−<em>i</em><em>γ</em><sub><em>j</em></sub><em>H</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></sup></span></p>
                                <p>where each <span class="math inline"><em>γ</em><sub><em>j</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub><em>j</em></sub></span> is a free parameter, and we repeatedly apply unitaries generated by <span class="math inline"><em>H</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>H</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> times.</p>
                                <p>We need now need to work our how to encode our problem in terms of the ground state of a Hamiltonian. The cost of our solution is given by the difference of the sums of the two sets, i.e. <code>sum(S1) - sum(S2)</code>. As <span class="math inline"><em>S</em>1 ∪ <em>S</em>2 = <em>S</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>S</em>1 ∩ <em>S</em>2 = ∅</span>, this is equivalent to taking a weighted sum over <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span>, where we assign a weight of <span class="math inline"> − 1</span> to elements partitioned into <span class="math inline"><em>S</em>2</span>. We can describe this with the Hamiltonian</p>
                                <p><span class="math display"><em>H</em><sub><em>P</em></sub> = (∑<sub><em>i</em> ∈ <em>S</em></sub>  <em>s</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><em>σ</em><sub><em>z</em></sub><sup>(<em>i</em>)</sup>)<sup>2</sup></span></p>
                                <p>Where <span class="math inline"><em>σ</em><sub><em>z</em></sub></span> is the Pauli <span class="math inline"><em>z</em></span> operator, and the superscript indicates it acts on the <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>th qubit. Clearly the lowest energy state for this Hamiltonian corresponds to a partitioning of the elements of <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> that minimizes the difference between sum(<span class="math inline"><em>S</em>1</span>) and sum(<span class="math inline"><em>S</em>2</span>). Now that we have encoded the cost minimization into the energy levels of a Hamiltonian, we’re ready to translate our idea into code.</p>
                                <p>After defining our <span class="math inline"><em>H</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>H</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span> as quantum objects (a matrix with more bells and whistles) with <code>QuTiP</code>’s <code>Qobj</code> class, we can define our VQA as follows</p>
                                <script src="https://gist.github.com/EnBr55/e9a63c0ef1de1faef0b5f5d2fe4df223.js"></script>
                                <p>This has constructed a quantum circuit that looks as follows</p>
                                <figure>
                                <img src="../images/vqa_in_qutip_circuit.png" title="Circuit generated by VQA." alt="Circuit generated by VQA." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Circuit generated by VQA.</figcaption>
                                </figure>
                                <p>After calling the <code>optimize_parameters</code> method,</p>
                                <figure>
                                <img src="../images/vqa_in_qutip_plot.png" title="Plot of measurement outcome probabilities from circuit." alt="Plot of measurement outcome probabilities from circuit." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Plot of measurement outcome probabilities from circuit.</figcaption>
                                </figure>
                                <p>Here, we have passed in the <code>label_sets</code> parameter to the plot function, which labels measurement outcomes by their corresponding set partitioning of the problem instance.</p>
                                <p>There are many parameters to tweak here, such as the number of layers used, initialization conditions, the optimization algorithm parameters and constraints as well as gradient computations. It is the hope that this tool allows anyone to dive straight into VQAs.</p>
                                <h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>
                                <p>There are always possible optimizations and additions for a tool with this kind of scope. There have already been some great suggestions on the associated <a href="https://github.com/qutip/qutip-qip/issues/118">GitHub Issue</a> for integrating this with other <code>QuTiP</code> tools, and when the pull request goes up there will likely be more. Please feel free to contribute or join the discussion!</p>
                                <p>This project has laid the foundations for a very general set of tools to define VQA problems. Hopefully the code written is robust enough that expansions to allow more specific formulations is possible.</p>
